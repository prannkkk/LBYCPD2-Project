# Automated Software Similarity Checker
Information about the software project of our group in  LBYCPD2

# Description
   The project is an Automated Software Similarity Checker which allows users to check the sameness of two files. The following will talk about the features of the project. It has a log-in system which asks the user to input his/her credentials. However, registration will be required for first time users. The users are able to upload files to for the checking process as well as store files for future comparisons. After the process, a similarity score will be provided to determine how similar the compared files are. This software is important, especially nowadays, because plagiarism of work is widespread. This will be helpful to all programmers, especiallly instructors in the educational field, to be able to make sure of a submitted work is plagiarized or not. At the same time, it protects the original work of a plagiarized code. The project also aims to develop an efficient and precise algorithm in determining the similarity score.
